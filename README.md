## HTML Elements
I used a variety of HTML elements, including headers, paragraphs, tables, lists, and images, to structure and display content. HTML5 semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<nav>` were used for better structure.

## HTML Validation
The front page's HTML is validated using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/). [Link to validation result]

CSS was used to style elements, change layouts, fonts, colors, and create a consistent design. Global styles were applied to maintain consistency.
